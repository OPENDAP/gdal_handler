2012-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added GRiB and JPEG2000 files to data dir; torqued around the
	build a bit more.

	M    configure.ac

	M    Makefile.am

2012-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gdal-1.9.1 for the 'local' API option.

2012-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests cleaned...

2012-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the build to support a local copy of GDAL.

2012-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Update of the tests directory - now it has a test
	program (tests/testsuite) that can also generate baselines for
	given bescmd files. look at the --generate and --generate-data
	options (--help)

2012-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	old test files - kept for posterity's sake

2012-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	single set of test driver files and their baselines

2012-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added an 'old' directory for files I'd like to keep but not have
	people use.

2012-07-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Found and fixed an error in bes.conf.in.

	M    tests/bes.conf.in

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	more svn nonsense

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the name of the shared object library so it's called
	libgdal_module.so like all the other modules (it was also called
	that in the gdal.conf file that was installed by default).

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Maybe now, with the previously hidden files ignored, the SVN stuff
	will appear correctly in Eclipse

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set svn ignore on many files in an attempt to get Eclipse to show
	modification status correctly.

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ignored files...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hack that might fix the dataset name problem - made at home and
	the new BES hacks this handler needs are not in SVN yet...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	fixed leaking resource problem: The handler depended on being able
	to keep the file open when accessing data (this was OK in the
	original version because the handler was a CGI and the file was
	closed each time the handler/program exited). I subclassed DataDDS
	so that the open GDAL handler for the dataset is closed using the
	DataDDS (really GDALDDS) destructor. I fixed a slew of memory
	leaks in the old code, and in the process, found a bug in libdap.
	This handler requires libdap >= 3.12.0

	Changes to the Grid constructor to allow the Grid to open and
	close the input itself. Fails in DODS case

2012-06-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Some minor changes like adding #define DODS_DEBUG and then
	commenting it out. The only substantial changes are to GDALGrid
	where I fixed the signature of read() and added my own impls of
	the copy ctor and operator=. Changing the type signature of read()
	fixed the bug that was making the data requests barf.

2012-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes made during some debugging work. Added instrumentation and
	hacked up some stuff in tests, data directories. It seems that
	there is a 'slicing' bug in the code when instances of GDDALGrid
	are added to the DDS object, although I do not where/how this is
	happening.

2012-06-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the bes.conf.in file plus some new tests (bescmd
	scripts in tests/gdal).

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked bes.conf.in and Makefile.am here in tests so that they work.

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some test data.

2012-05-03  brent

	configuration and source for geotiff files. dods dataset part not
	working. dds, ddx, das working.

2012-01-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added, hopefully correctly this time.

2012-01-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More hacks; now builds and includes all parts of a BES handler.
	Fixed the exec property (should be off for all of these files).

	Now it's a BES handler...

2012-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked in the old code to build a DDS. It's not elegant, but it
	should work.

2012-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed build, added copyrights, otherwise normalized; almost a BES
	handler.
