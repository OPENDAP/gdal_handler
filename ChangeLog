2013-11-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the pec file to use the current name of the gdal package in the
	dependencies.

	M    gdal_handler.spec

2013-10-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Edits to match the new, sane, semantics for BaseType::read(). True now means done/eof and flase means more data to read (more instances for a sequence). All the tests pass.

2013-10-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	svn ignore updated; minor change in GDALArray.cc (using <> for an include)

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This handler used a bogus definition of BaseType::read() which caused various warnings with clang 5.

2013-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed -fno-defer-pop from all copies of Makefile.am since the new OSX compiler prints warnings about it and it seems to not make a difference with newer g++ versions.

	Update of the tests directory - now it has a test
	program (tests/testsuite) that can also generate baselines for
	given bescmd files. look at the --generate and --generate-data
	options (--help)

2012-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	single set of test driver files and their baselines

	Added an 'old' directory for files I'd like to keep but not have
	people use.

	more svn nonsense

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the name of the shared object library so it's called
	libgdal_module.so like all the other modules (it was also called
	that in the gdal.conf file that was installed by default).

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Maybe now, with the previously hidden files ignored, the SVN stuff
	will appear correctly in Eclipse

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set svn ignore on many files in an attempt to get Eclipse to show
	modification status correctly.

2012-07-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ignored files...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hack that might fix the dataset name problem - made at home and
	the new BES hacks this handler needs are not in SVN yet...

2012-07-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	fixed leaking resource problem: The handler depended on being able
	to keep the file open when accessing data (this was OK in the
	original version because the handler was a CGI and the file was
	closed each time the handler/program exited). I subclassed DataDDS
	so that the open GDAL handler for the dataset is closed using the
	DataDDS (really GDALDDS) destructor. I fixed a slew of memory
	leaks in the old code, and in the process, found a bug in libdap.
	This handler requires libdap >= 3.12.0

2012-07-25  brent

	Changes to the Grid constructor to allow the Grid to open and
	close the input itself. Fails in DODS case

2012-06-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Some minor changes like adding #define DODS_DEBUG and then
	commenting it out. The only substantial changes are to GDALGrid
	where I fixed the signature of read() and added my own impls of
	the copy ctor and operator=. Changing the type signature of read()
	fixed the bug that was making the data requests barf.

2012-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes made during some debugging work. Added instrumentation and
	hacked up some stuff in tests, data directories. It seems that
	there is a 'slicing' bug in the code when instances of GDDALGrid
	are added to the DDS object, although I do not where/how this is
	happening.

2012-06-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes to the bes.conf.in file plus some new tests (bescmd
	scripts in tests/gdal).

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked bes.conf.in and Makefile.am here in tests so that they work.

2012-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added some test data.

	Hacked in the old code to build a DDS. It's not elegant, but it
	should work.
