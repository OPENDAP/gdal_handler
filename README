Updated for version 0.9.1

This is build fix.

Note that JP2 files will need gdal 1.9.1 built with Jasper and jpeg-8d. 
I have not included the Jasper in the gdal-1.9.1 directory.

Updated for version 0.9.0 on 25 Sept. 2012

This is the initial release of a handler to read GeoTIFF,
GRiB and JPEG2000 files.
